 * Ideally, our plugin would be variant aware and would let us define multiple navigation source
 * sets and configurations to match the build types, flavors and variants of the main source code.
 * However, there is a limitation in the current gradle android plugin and we can't do that. We are
 * falling back on a single source set that will contain all the navigation models, for all
 * activities of a module (the union of all variants of the module). This is sad but we can't do it
 * well.
 *
 * <p>This class represents the navigation source set and its various configurations to compile and
